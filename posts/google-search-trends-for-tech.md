Google Trends is more than just a tool for marketers; it's a powerful resource for developers to gauge public interest in technologies, programming languages, and frameworks. By analyzing search data, you can spot emerging trends before they become mainstream.

This guide teaches you how to use Google Trends to compare the popularity of different technologies (e.g., React vs. Vue), identify regional interest in specific tech stacks, and discover breakout search queries that could inspire your next side project or startup idea. We'll explore practical strategies for turning raw search data into actionable insights.

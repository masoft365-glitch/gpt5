Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications without thinking about servers. AWS Lambda is a cornerstone of this paradigm, letting you run code in response to events and automatically managing the underlying compute resources for you.

This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through creating a "Hello, World!" API. We will write a simple Node.js function, configure it in AWS Lambda, and expose it to the world using Amazon API Gateway. You'll learn the fundamentals of serverless architecture and see just how easy it is to deploy highly scalable applications.

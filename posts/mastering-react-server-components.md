React Server Components represent one of the most significant shifts in the React paradigm since Hooks. By allowing components to run exclusively on the server, RSCs enable developers to build faster, more efficient applications with zero client-side JavaScript for static parts of the UI.

This guide breaks down the mental model for Server Components, contrasting them with traditional Client Components. We'll walk through practical examples, showing you how to fetch data on the server, reduce bundle sizes, and improve initial page load times. We'll also cover advanced patterns and the integration of RSCs with frameworks like Next.js.
